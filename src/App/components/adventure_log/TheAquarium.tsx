                Not long after the <br/>skating incident, <br/> the
                two decided to  <br/>visit the aquarium. <br/> It was
                a very fun day <br/> filled with sea animals and
                love. They grew closer as they walked around
                talking about animals and themselves. They stayed in the 
                aquarium until it closed and left satisfied.
