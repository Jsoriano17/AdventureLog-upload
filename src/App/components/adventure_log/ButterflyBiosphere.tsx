                The butterfly biosphere a<br/> place I almost forgot 
                about, I'm sure <br/>Jeff's tried to. This place<br/> was 
                a nightmare for Jeff.<br/> The place was filled with <br/>
                insects and he was<br/> terrified of all of them.<br/> 
                Savannah on the other<br/> hand seemingly wanted to 
                hold all of them(really showing Jeff up here). 
                It was a cool experience for Jeff but he wanted 
                out ASAP. Savannah got Jeff to hold a butterfly 
                and the two-headed home.
