            <StyledParagraph3>
                was falling every to seconds busting his knees and writs. Not too long after

            <StyledParagraph4>
                Jeff's pants ripped exposing himself(what a way to impress a girl).
                He was very embarrassed and the two had to leave to get
                new ones. After Jeff got new pants they went hiking in
                the mountains where they relaxed near a waterfall under
                the stars.
